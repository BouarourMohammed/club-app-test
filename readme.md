## Project Overview

This application allows users to view a list of football clubs and see details about each club and its players. Key features include:

## Data Model

Data models and test data generation are detailed in the files [src/types/index.ts](src/types/index.ts), [src/store/thunks/dataThunks.ts](src/store/thunks/dataThunks.ts).
